# AppointmentTracking
Intermediate Web Programming - Final Project
In this project our group chose to create an appointment tracking website.
The website needed to allow clients to book appointments with doctors, informing the doctor of their ailments and have the choice to cancel booking if need be,
Doctors were required to be able to add additional time slots, remove time slots that don't work anymore, and be able to see all appointsments clients had booked with them.
Administrators needed access to all levels of the website, including being able to create client/doctor accounts.
The website needed to have login page.
